Week 2 Assignment - PDF Text Extraction and ChromaDB
=================================================

Step 1: Creating a sample PDF...
Sample PDF created at sample.pdf

Step 2: Extracting text from the PDF...
Extracted 1245 characters of text
Sample of extracted text:
Sample PDF Document

This is a sample PDF document created for testing the PDF text extraction function.

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings.
These embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture semantic meaning.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with generative AI to enhance the quality and accuracy of generated content...
Full extracted text saved to 'extracted_text.txt'

Step 3: Initializing ChromaDB and storing the document...
ChromaDB initialized with collection: pdf_documents
Added 8 documents to the collection

Step 4: Querying the ChromaDB collection...
Query: What is Agentic RAG?

Result 1:
Document: Agentic RAG takes this further by incorporating autonomous decision-making capabilities into the retrieval and generation process.
This allows the system to independently determine what information to retrieve and how to use it effectively.
